/*
 * This test exposes a bug in Linux kernel in v2.6.31.1 and v2.6.32.1.
 * It is designed to run on both the emulated environments of 
 * kernel v2.6.31.1 and v2.6.32.1.
 * The bug is present in both multi-level hierarchies (-DMULTI_LEVEL) 
 * and single-node hierarchies.
 *
 * The bug was present in RCU versions prior to commit d09b62dfa336
 * (v.2.6.32), and was caused by unsynchronized accesses to the
 * ->completed field of the rcu_state struct.
 *
 * This test demonstrates how this bug may cause callbacks whose grace
 * period has not ended to be called prematurely. That can cause
 * trouble if there were pre-existing readers when a callback
 * was registered, and the callback is invoked before these readers
 * complete their RCU read-side critical sections.
