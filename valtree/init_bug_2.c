/*
 * This test is supposed to expose a bug in Linux kernel v.2.6.31.
 *
 * The bug was present in RCU versions prior to commit 83f5b01ffbba, 
 * which fixes a long-grace-period race between grace period forcing 
 * and grace period initialization.
 *
 * Our test, however, shows that no such bug or race exists, and that
 * the scenario outlined in the commit log is impossible to happen.
 * More specifically, it is impossible to enter the RCU_SAVE_DYNTICK
 * leg of the switch statement in force_quiescent_state() before a 
 * grace period ends and record the dynticks_completed value after a
 * new grace period has started. There are two "if-statements" that
 * prevent this scenario from happening. 
 *
 * In order to prove this, proper assertions at force_quiescent_state() 
 * are inserted when -DFQS_NO_BUG is defined. This alleged bug requires 
 * at least three CPUs (-DCONFIG_NR_CPUS=3), and a multi-level RCU 
 * architecture (-DCONFIG_RCU_FANOUT=2).
 *
 * This test is the same as init_bug.c, but with separate threads for
 * each CPU.
